# Testing
Back to the [README](README.md)

* Testing has taken place continuously throughout the development of the project. Each view was tested regularly. 
  When the outcome was not as expected, debugging occured at that point.  

### Python Validation - CI Python Linter
* Python testing was done using the CI Python Linter to ensure no syntax errors in the project. All python files
were entered into the online checker and no errors were found in any of the custom codes.

## Manual Testing
### Frontend
* The Registration, Login, and Logout systems have no issues and are working accordingly. The right 
  interactive messages are shown to the users.
* The Profile Page is working properly. It updates the user´s information and uploads/updates the 
  user´s profile image. It shows the interactive message to the user once the update is complete.
* All the internal links are working and bring the user to the right page on the website.
* All the external links are working, and the user is brouhgt to the right social media page by 
  opening a new browser tab.
* The About page is working and all the links work.
* The contact form on the Contact Page is working without any errors. The links on the contact page work.
* The Blog drop-down menu in the navbar shows a list of categories on every page of the website.
* The Category Page shows the blog posts filtered by category without issues.
* The pagination system is working. It adds another page after 6 posts on the category and home pages.
* On the Post Details Page, the Like/unlike functionality works without issues and shows 
  the right interactive message to the user when the heart icon is clicked. The comment count icon works.
* The comment form has no issues and it submits a new comment once the form is completed by a
  registered user. 
  The comment is displayed once the submit button is pressed. The interactive message for 
  this action is working without errors. 
* The functionality to delete a comment, previously sent by the user or the superuser, is 
  working without issues. The Bootstrap model opens to ask the user if they want to delete 
  the comment. Once the action is complete, the interactive message is displayed at the top of the page.
* The functionality to update a comment, previously sent by the user or by the superuser, is 
  working without issues. The comment appears in the comment box so that the comment can be updated when the update button is pressed. Once the action is complete, the interactive message is displayed at the top of the page. 
* The Jobs drop-down menu in the navbar shows a list of specialities on every page of the website.
* Each Speciality page shows all the jobs in that speciality with a pagination of 9 that is working.
* On the Job Detail´s Page, the star Rating system is working. The Job Application Form is shown to all users except  
  logged-in employers. The Form works with interactive messages to guide the applicant. Only regular logged-in users can submit the form successfully and will be directed to the rating page after the first application to a particular job. Other site users will be directed to the Registration page to register. 
* Applicants can submit a job application, rate the job if they choose, and later editor or delete their job 
  applications.
* The Star Rating system for the jobs is working. The internal links are working with the submit or return buttons.
* Logged-in employers can create a new Job. On thier profile Page they can update or delete their jobs, also any job 
  can be updated or deleted by the Superuser. 
* Regular logged-in users receive a 403 error if they click the Add Job and other site users don´t see the Add Job 
  link. This was extra done this way for this project to show two ways of controlling what site users can see and do.
  In the future, this will be changed so that the regular users also don´t see the Add Job link.
* All logged-in users can create Posts with the Add Post link. On their profiles they can edit or delete their posts.

### Backend/Admin Panel
* I have tested the Admin Panel repeatedly since the start of the project development. All the models are working without issues.  
  I have created, deleted, and updated data in all models without errors. The models have the behavior expected for what they were built for.
* Whenever a user submits a post the Superuser has to approve it before it will be displayed on the website. This functionality is working without issues.
* When the author is posting a new post or job all the required fields have to be filled otherwise the author can't submit the post or job to the database.

### Manual Test Case
The Test case for this project can be found in [Test Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZ669fc7kGioveRR7f4MxRvTSzsaiUpqkPg0tNpNJUM/edit?usp=sharing).

# Bugs
## Fixed Bugs
* Initially for the Job Form I intended the user to give a duration period for the jobs. 
![Add Job](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725957924/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/Add-job-Django-site-admin_ctjsgv.png).
* I then changed the job model to have a set start and end date. I later fixed the bug of the start date being in the past and the end date possibly being before the start date.
![Past dates](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725957924/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/Global-Doctors_uimnun.png).
* I created the above job on the 26.08.2024 making both start and end dates in the past.
![Fixed date inputs](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725957924/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/startdateinpast_dljbr0.png).
* I changed the code to fix the input dates.
* Also on the Job Model, I changed the fact that the title doesn´t have to be unique as this is a problem for employers as they would always be looking for applicants for the same jobs and unlike posts the job titles are similar or even the same in some cases. The uniqueness of the Job would be in the Job_ID created by Django automatically and programmatically accessible. 
* In the early development stage of the project I mistakenly created a post twice through the admin with the same title and that caused my database to crash. With tutor support, I understood my mistake but I was advised to create another database. 
![Category display error](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725959580/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/views-py-travel-doc-Gitpod-Code_yyvnsm.png).
![Category display error](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725959580/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/KeyError-at-category-Doctors-Stories-_bl5fkg.png).
![Category display fix](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725959580/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/-views-py-travel-doc-Gitpod-Code_hchu9j.png).
* In my initial code for the Catlistview which was to show all the posts in a specific category with a pagination of 6, I had not defined the context_data that Django was to get. It was not showing any of the posts until I defined the get function to tell Django to get all the posts with the same category_name and display them accordingly. 
![Regular profile image fix](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1726056857/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/regularprofilefix_x26eeg.png).
![Employer profile image fix](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1726056857/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/employerprofilefix_nese06.png).
* In the initial code in the regular profile template only the profile.profile_image.url was being rendered even if no image was uploaded which resulted in a broken link. The default image was never rendered. In the initial employer profile template only the placeholder picture was rendered even if an image was uploaded from the user. The fix in the code was similar to the working code in the templates for the blog posts which first checked in the 'if' statement if there was a placeholder. If there was a placeholder it would be displayed if not then the uploaded image was displayed.

## Unfixed Bugs
![Email](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725957447/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/-send_email-py-travel-doc-Gitpod-Code_pycjmh.png).
* I spent a considerable amount of time trying to get the send email app to work using both Gmail and Mailgun as 
external email providers. Through trail and error, I found out the code works when using Visual Studio Code but not while using Gitpod. After asking Tutor support, I was informed that Gitpod for protection purposes blocks external outbound providers. I left the code in the project because I will work on this section in the future as I find it a very vital part of the possible communication process for the website.
* A regular logged-in user can fill the job application forms with different names and email addresses and edit and change these fields. While the CRUD functionality is desired and important some regulation is needed. A possible fix would be to establish email confirmation of regular users and that only this email address can be used to apply for jobs. 
* Another big problem is in the backend where the admin has a lot of work to do to monitor the status of all the job applications. A solution here is also an emailing system that handles the emailing sequences and replies.  
![Login failed](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzesjeplp/image/upload/v1725961286/READMEpp4/TESTINGpp4/Bugs/loginfailed_gksgwl.png).
* If a user has forgotten their password or username, there is no way for them to retrieve this information because of the missing email communication. Even if they contact the admin via email or telephone to change their password, the admin has no access to this information due to the built-in authentification protection from Django.
